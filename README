Checks the MIT website every 5 minutes to see if the admission decision has come yet.

Read the comments in the file to find the things to change so that the script works as you want it to.

Note, I am not sure what is going to happen when they put out admission decisions, so I have taken several different approaches to checking what has changed on the site:

- If the main page redirects you to somewhere other than verify.php
- If logging into verify.php gives a different result

Hopefully one of these will work, and if it does, it will email you at the address provided. NOTE: Only gmail accounts work with the email sending thing. Sorry!

Also, I'm taking a few educated guesses about how the final site will work, so it will try to log in if it finds a form in a few of the places, and email you the results from that.

Just be warned, this might spam your email for a little bit while the decisions are going up. Hopefully that won't stress you out too much.
