Checks the MIT website every 5 minutes to see if the admission decision has come yet.

Note, I am not sure what is going to happen when they put out admission decisions, so I have taken several different approaches to checking what has changed on the site:

- If the main page redirects you to somewhere other than verify.php
- If logging into verify.php gives a different result

Hopefully one of these will work, and if it does, it will email you at the address provided. Have fun!
